									<h1>Hi! I am Sanad Dhital...</h1>
									<p>I am a senior at Park University, Kansas City, MO. I am studying Mathematics with Statistics Minor. 
										I am also doing three certificate programs: GIS, Project Management and Drone Operation.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/myDP.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p> My domain of interest lies within Data Analytics and GIS.</p>
								<p>I am very proficient in collecting, cleaning, analyzing datasets and managing relational database. 
									I have been using SQL and Python for last 2 years. Currently, I am also halfway done with 
									Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate where I learned to use Tableau and R. 
									This course helped me acquire new professional skills and data-focused problem-solving approach. 
									I am looking forward to becoming a Data Scientist in the future. </p>
								
								<p> It was last year, I added GIS certificate course with my degree, and I learned a lot about spatial data.
									 Since then, Cartography has been a way of expressing my art. I enjoy working with maps very much these days.</p>
								
								<p> I have worked on many academic projects using ArcGIS, ArcGIS pro and QGIS. This also helped me boost my data manipulation 
									and spatial data query skills with the application of GIS tools, SQL and ArcPy. I have become very proficient in acquisition, 
									mapping, and geospatial analysis of spatial data. One of my personal favorite projects I am currently working on is 3D design of
									 Kansas City downtown using Open Street Maps data in Blender 3D. I am new to 3D software world, and I am still learning basics. 
									 Hopefully, I will have that project completed soon.</p>
								<p>I am currently working as a Student Tutor for Academic Success Centre at my University. I tutor different Mathematics and 
									Statistics courses to college students. I have tutored more than 50 students and assisted them to complete their math requirement in college.
									 It is very satisfying to hear kind words from those students who I helped to complete their degree.</p>
								
								<p>Outside of that, I am a Drone Pilot. I have been flying drones since last 3 years and building drones since last year. I have built 3 fpv drones and 
									I fly them in my free time or during travelling new places. I also started Drone Club at my University and helped many students take their first drone flight.</p>
								
								<p>I like to play guitar in my free time and watch anime.</p>
